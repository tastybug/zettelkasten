# Arc Forum

The Chapter and everyone who is interesting in our code and architecture meet every $DAY to debate about concrete technical topics as for example:

* Changes in the architecture that will influence other teams or units
* Knowledge sharing about challenges, pitfalls, and smart solution
* Technical debt management for quarter plannings
* Tech discovery and architectural vision
* Questions like "How will we build this in the future?", "How do other teams do this?", "We should really change this part here", "What do you all think about technology xyz and how might it improve our backend?"
* Open for any topic, open for anybody who wants to discuss with us
