# Elastic Beanstalk

Runs web apps based on Java, .net, php etc. Runs on underlying EC2 instances.
You provide the deployable, AWS does the deployment.
The app, once started, will be behind a load balancer, running on EC2, have autoscaling and so on.
Elastic Beanstalk itself is free, but the underlying resources might not be.
