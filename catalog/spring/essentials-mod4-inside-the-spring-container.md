# Inside the Spring Container, the Bean Lifecycle and Proxies

## Container Lifecycle Phases

The Spring container goes through 3 phases:

1. Initialization: Beans are created and depencency injection occurs
2. Usage: Beans are used during the application runtime
3. Destruction: Beans are released for GC

## Init Phase

This kicks off when `SpringApplication.run(AppConfig.class)` is executed. Here, the Bean definitions (e.g. annotations) are loaded and then the Beans are created in the necessary order according to the configured dependency graph. All this is done in the `BeanFactory`, which happens to be the `ApplicationContext`.
This init phase comes with extension points that give you means to change things programmatically.


### Extension Point 1: Changing Bean Configuration Before Bean Creation
There is an extension point in the `BeanFactory` that allows programmatic changes to the Bean definitions before the Bean creation happens. This is the `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` interface. This extension point is for example used by the `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`, which looks up values for the `@Value("${foo}")` annotation. This behaviour could be overridden with a custom instance of `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`.

This is how one can create a custom post processor:

```java
// notice that this is static!
@Bean
public static BeanFactoryPostProcessor deprecatedBeanWarner() {
  return new DeprecatedBeanWarner();
}

public class DeprecatedBeanWarner implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor {
  // example: log warnings when using classes marked as @Deprecated
  // this post processor already comes with Spring btw
}
```

### Extension Point 2: Changing Beans Post-Creation

The `BeanPostProcessor` is an important extension point that can modify bean instances or even return other instances, replacing Bean types. It will run against every Bean. It can modify a Bean before and/or after Initialization (`BeforeInit` and `AfterInit`).

This is the `BeanPostProcessor` interface:

```java
public interface BeanPostProcessor {
  public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object originalBean, String beanName);
  public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object originalBean, String beanName);
}
```

### More on Bean Dependencies

The container has to figure out the order in which Beans are to be created. If the dependency is not explicit, you can do:

```
@Bean
@DependsOn("accountService")
public MyBean myBean() {
  return ...;
}
```

## Usage Phase: Proxy or Not?

The usage phase starts when you fetch beans from the `ApplicationContext`, usually via `@Autowired`. But what is it really returning?

```java
var service = context.getBean("transferService", TransferService.class);
service.transfer(...);
```

Sometimes the Bean implementation is decorated with security concerns, transaction handling or other AOP things. In that situation, the Bean is wrapped by a Proxy, which was done by a `BeanPostProcessor` during the Init Phase. It transparently returned a proxy `object` instead of the plain Bean.

### 2 Kinds Of Proxies

Spring supports `JDK Proxy` (part of the JDK) and `CGLib Proxy`. Vanilla Spring will use the first option when the bean implements an `interface` and fall back to CGLib when it's not. Spring Boot apparently changes that insofar that CGLib is always used.

How do they differ:
* `JDK Proxy` extends the `interface`, adding extra logic on top
* `CGLib Proxy` is subclass based and `extends` the Bean to add extra logic

## Destruction Phase

This starts when you run `context.close()`, likely via a JVM hook. What happens then?

* `@PreDestroy` is executed on beans that have that annotation
* Bean is released to GC

This only happens on graceful shutdowns and not if the VM is killed.
