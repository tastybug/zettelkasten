# Connecting to GCP and/or the Google Network

Broadly speaking you might have the following challenges:

* have 2 organizations in GCP with infrastructure that you want to connect (layer 2)
* increase your network throughput between Google and own services (layer 3)
* have GCP resources and the own on-prem services on the same private network (layer 2)

## Layer 2, Option 1: IPSec VPN Tunnel (also with HA option)

This is realistic for low-ish data volume. VPN SLA is given as 99,9%.

HA VPN is a flavor of this with an SLA of 99,99%.

> Expected throughput is 1.5 - 3 Gbps per tunnel

## Layer 2, Option 2: VPC Peering between different GCP VPCs

You have different VPCs, possibly belonging to different GCP organizations.
The subnet range must not overlap in this case.

## Layer 2, Option 3: Cloud Interconnect

This achieves the same result as a VPN, but allows for more throughput due to a physical connection. It requires co-location of at least the router of the customer in one of the supported data centers (they are spread all around the world).
SLA is given as 99,9% up to 99,99%.

> Expected throughout 10 Gbps (100 Gbps in beta) per link

## Layer 2, Option 4: Partner Interconnect

If `Cloud Interconnect` is unrealistic, peering via a service provider is possible (they might be closer to your physical location). This likely means shared infrastructure in between GCP and the onprem network and thus lower throughput.

> Expected throughput is 50 Mbps - 10 Gbps per connection

## Layer 3, Options 1&2: Direct or Carrier Peering

One is able to connect directly to Google Edge “Points of Presence” (PoPs). Alternatively, this can also be done via a Carrier inbetween, giving you more geographical flexibility (Carrier has alternative PoPs). The result of this is an increase in network throughput.

Example: Video Content Provider that wants to upload massive amounts of content on a regular basis.

> There are no SLAs for Peering. Throughput is given as 10 Gbps for direct peering and “depends on carrier” for Carrier peering
