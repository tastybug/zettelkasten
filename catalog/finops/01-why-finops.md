# Why FinOps

FinOps helps to understand the Cloud not simply as a hosting provider, but as a business accelerator. It's not so much about cost optimization, but about maximizing value.

> FinOps can enable unit economics: a per-unit understanding of infra costs.

In 2022, the overall cloud spend is $500 billion, until 2025 this is expected to climb to $1.8 trillion.
With large companies spending millions in the cloud, the silos between tech, procurement and business become a problem.

The old procurement processes don't work anymore. Cloud is self-service and on-demand. Engineers can request resources for pennies and a micro-procurement process only slows down innovation, a mayor side effect of cloud adoption.
