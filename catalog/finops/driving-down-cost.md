# Title

This formular decides what one pays:

> Spend = Usage x Rate 

Given that, how can `Spend` be reduced:

* `Usage`: simply reduce what you use
* `Waste`: remove idle resources
* `Capacity Rightsizing`: use appropriately sized resources 
* `Temporal Rightsizing`: during off-peak hours, or over weekends switch things off or scale down
* `Location Rightsizing`: resource cost can differ by region
* `Rate Reduction`: take advantage of constructs like reserved instances, committed use discounts
