# FinOps Lifecycle 

3 Phases

## Inform

Get visibility and a sense of shared accountability by teams on spend and the why.

Proposed steps:
* __Kickoff__: ask questions, communicate intend
* __Gain Visibility__ into what's happening in your cloud environment
* __Achieve Cost Allocation__ by learning which cost center is truly responsible for which usage before making changes 

At the end of this, summarize your findings and data:

1) Context: build context around your data; which cost centers are there
2) Data: show/visualize cost data, maybe plan for optimizations and efficiency
3) Forecast: we can start making forecasts, budgets on which alerts can be build to detect unexpected increases in spend
4) Budgets: describing current spend and limits


## Optimize



## Operate
