# The UI of FinOps

Reports/dashboards are a central _product_ of FinOps. This product is supposed to have good data quality, UX and clarity, which in turn will create trust in what is presented.

## Build vs Buy vs Native: when to use what

Where to get your dashboards from:

* native tooling (Google Cloud Cost Management, AWS Cost Explorer etc)
* buy;
  * SaaS: might allow neat inter-cloud visibility
  * buy-then-augment: get some commercial tool, then build your stuff on top of it
* homegrown; this category includes using Tableau, Looker, GBQ and other cloud building blocks

A good starting point is the native tooling, which gives you good insights with little effort. As your FinOps practive matures, the question will be build or buy. 

There can be a multitude of reasons to build:

* control over your own data
* having internal expertise
* easier integration with internal data lakes
* compliance reasons
* and the usual like avoiding vendor lock-in, flexibility, cost structures as things scale

Reasons to buy instead:

* fast time to value
* complex math like armotized RI already there
* and the usual like avoiding to put your devs on problems that aren't your core biz
