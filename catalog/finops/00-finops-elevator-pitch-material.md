## What's FinOps?

It's about establishing a culture in a company. A culture of awareness of the value of cloud adoption as well as cost awareness. About bringing this into relation to the business value created with that cloud usage.

For many companies this is primarily about cost attribution, meaning knowing what you use and in which context (e.g. which business context uses what resources).

There is a FinOps nirvana of achieving unit economics awareness. Where one is able to say: processing this order incurs cloud cost of 30cents, spread over the following cloud resources A, B and C. And then, on this crystal clear awareness, you start to have discussions on where you want to go: reduce cost? Increase processing speed? Improve visibility to the customer? What cloud tech adoption gets us there?

## A FinOps Journey

1. `Uninformed Ignorance Phase`: cloud is in use, but there is not cost tracking in place. No one cares, there is more important things to do. The risk of unexpected spent is high and a cost/value awareness is not available.
2. `Informed Ignorance Phase`: there is finally visibility on spent and a rough forecast. Things look non-threatening, so management decides to ignore spent for now.
