# Cultural Shift and the FinOps Team

FinOps spans finance, operations, developers, architects to executives. It spans multiple business domains.

A best practice is to have a centralized team that acts as a enabler for the business line teams.
The centralized team is like a platform team for a financial lens on things, providing shared tooling, insights, knowledge. The cost center teams/domain owners/engineering teams then need to act on the input. The domain owners have the knowledge to tell if rightsizing is possible, where waste is truly wasteful and so on.

## Responsibilities of the Functional Departments

### Executive Level

* drive accountability and transparency
* watch over efficiency
* drive the cultural shift that makes engineers consider costs as an efficiency metric

### Finance

* use reporting from the FinOps team for accounting and forecasting
* work with central FinOps to understand historical billing data so that robust cost models can be created
* engange in rate negotiations with cloud providers

### Procurement and Sourcing

Manage the relation to vendors like cloud providers. With help of finance, they need to engange in rate negotiations.

### Product / Business Teams (incl. PM, EM) / Developers / Ops

* introduce cost as a metric contributing to efficiency measurement
* they optimize the "USE" part of the equasion "COST = USE x RATE"
  * evaluate rightsizing, waste reduction
  * give feedback on whether spending anomalies are expected or problematic
* working with the central team, they want to understand the total cost of running features, products and services
* gauge profitability taking infra cost into account
* look into upcoming features with central and engineering, selecting the cloud resource with the best cost/value ration
* act (or not) on input from the central team

### Central FinOps Practitioner / Cloud Excellence Team

These folks are crossfunctional people with tech and finance knowledge.

* provide shared tooling, reporting (e.g. showback)
* provide alternatives to unefficiencies (e.g. storage class in cloud buckets)
* is generally an enabler for the resource owners
* drives best practices into the teams
* are the glue holding the different functions together
* is generally an enabler for the resource owners
* they optimize the "RATE" part of the equasion "COST = USE x RATE"
  * support rate negotiations with the cloud providers
  * provide alternatives to unefficiencies (e.g. storage class in cloud buckets)
