# Accelerate Metrics

Aim for good outcomes, not output.

* change failure rate: either changes that directly impair prod or changes that require rework
* Delivery lead time, of which there are these flavors
    * product delivery time (dev,test,rollout)
    * deployment lead time: how long it takes a commit to get into prod
    * product design/development delivery time (time from customer lead to rollout)
* Time to restore service
* Deployment frequency (indirectly influences the batch size = the amount of things happening in parallel)

Bureaucratic and pathological companies use metrics to punish or direct people. The metrics will be gamed and become useless.
