# How to communicate a finding

Specify the hypothesis:

“I observed that we struggle with component ownership”

Give 3 key reasons why I see that, for example

* I see that bugs do not have a clear assignee and linger
* Tech Debt is not removed, no one feels responsible
* …

In backup slides, provide links, pointers, data.

This is “Top Down” communication. It starts with a Goal (that the C-level might find relevant or not) and provides a sample of convincing reasons, why X is the case.

The result is interesting, not the process to get to the result.
